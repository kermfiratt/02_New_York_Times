        </a>  </h3>
        <p> President Biden plans a month of campaign-style barnstorming now that the general election contest has begun in earnest. Americans love a candidate who promises something new. But when a sitting president runs against a former one, can either claim the mantle of change? </p>

        <p> The labor market showed resiliency in February, another sign that economic growth is still strong. The White House said that President Biden would sign the bill on Saturday. But the spending fight isn’t over yet.</p>

        <p> Britain and the E.U. said they would help set up a maritime aid corridor to Gaza, after aid agencies said that Israel was not allowing in enough supplies. President Biden’s sending of aid represents a shift prompted by the humanitarian crisis. But it raises uncomfortable questions about America’s role. </p>

        <h3> <a href="#NEW"> A Forceful Biden Takes On Trump and His Own Doubters. Plan to Deliver Aid by Sea Faces Big Hurdles </a>  </h3>
        <p> In a raucous State of the Union address, President Biden sought to confront Donald Trump and reassure Americans that he was ready for a second term. U.S. officials conceded it would take weeks to make maritime aid delivery practical but say it would eventually allow a significant increase in aid to Gaza. </p>
